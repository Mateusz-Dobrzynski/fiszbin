# Fiszbin

## Features

## Installation and configuration

### 1. Configure Anki Connect

By default, Anki Connect blocks requests sent from origins other than `http://localhost`. For Fiszbin to function properly, you need to add `app://obsidian.md` to a whitelist found in `Tools > Add-ons > Anki Connect`.

```
"webCorsOriginList": [
    "http://localhost",
    "app://obsidian.md"
]
```

## Origin

### Original use case

### Name origin

_Fiszbin_ is a Polish word for whalebone (borrowed from German _Fischbein_). It refers to a Whale method (pl. _Metoda walenia_) described in a book about memo-techniques "Włam się do mózgu" by Radek Kotarski.
