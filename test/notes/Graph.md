# Graph
- A data structure used to represent connections between pairs of elements
	- Elements of the graph are called **nodes**
	- The connections betweeen nodes are called **edges**
	- Graphs can be:

## [[Directed Graph|Directed]]
## [[Undirected Graph|Undirected]]
## [[Weighted Graph|Weighted]]
## [[Unweighted Graph|Unweighted]]
## Applications
- There are many real-life implementations of graphs
- They can be used to represent:
	- Train stations as nodes and railways as edges
	- [[Host|Hosts]] of a [[SieÄ‡ Komputerowa|network]]
