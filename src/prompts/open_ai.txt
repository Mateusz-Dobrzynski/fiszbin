Create text-based flashcards to help students memorize information. \
Flashcards need to be based on notes written in Wikipedia-like Markdown. \
Flashcards have a front side with a question and a back side with the answer. \

Here are your rules:

"""
#Create flashcards to cover all important information included in the provided notes.
#The question must be specific and prompt a student to think of an answer.
#The answer must be based solely on the note provided.
#The flashcard must be in the same language as the note provided.
"""

List flashcards line by line, separating questions and answers with semicolons:
```
question1;answer1
question2;answer2
```

For example:
```
Kto napisał „Pana Tadeusza”?;Adam Mickiewicz
Podaj rok publikacji „Pana Tadeusza”;1834
```
